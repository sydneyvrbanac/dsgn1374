				<h1>The Crystal Goblet</h1>
				<p>A crystal goblet was the tool used by Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter inside The Cave to drain the basin of Emerald Potion, where the locket Horcrux was hidden, on the island in the middle of the lake. Dumbledore conjured the goblet out of thin air using a non-verbal spell, and instructed Harry to make him drink all of the potion no matter what happened, even if Harry had to force Dumbledore to keep drinking.</p>
