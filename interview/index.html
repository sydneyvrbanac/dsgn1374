			<h2>SYDNEY: When was the first time you realized you wanted to work in graphic design?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="a">
			<p>FRANK: "I was in my senior year of high school when I first realized I had an interest in graphic design. As a part of my business class, we had to create an infographic and logo for a made-up company. Up until that point I had considered myself an artist and enjoyed painting and calligraphy, but I hadn't tried applying it to a digital format. I was intrigued by it and decided to pursue a graphic design degree."</p>

		<div class="q">
			<h2>S: This role requires communication skills. Can you provide me with examples of relevant communication experiences you had in your previous job?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="a">
			<p>F: "In my previous position, I was responsible for communicating directly with my supervisor about a client's wishes for their logos or website designs. A large part of my role was understanding what the client envisioned and translating that into a digital design format. Throughout the duration of my projects, I enlisted the help of my coworkers to get constructive feedback and talked with my supervisor when a question arose so they could relay my concerns to the client."</p>
		</div> 

		<div class="q">
			<h2>S: How would you handle negative client feedback on one of your designs?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="a">
			<p>F: "Negative comments are always disappointing, as you want to deliver the best quality of work to represent your company and please the client. In these situations, I would use the client's feedback as fuel to revamp the project to incorporate their new vision and restructure my design based on the elements they disliked."</p>
		</div> 

		<div class="q">
			<h2>S: How would you explain the color theory to someone without any graphic design experience?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="a">
			<p>F: "Color theory is very important to graphic design as it theorizes that colors have a significant impact on a consumer's receptiveness of a design. It looks at the aesthetically pleasing nature of certain color combinations and the psychology of color. The aim of color theory is to help graphic designers and other artists to use colors in a purposeful way."</p>
